Hypixel Status Checker by Uffu
---------------------------------
What I have to do?

1. Install the newest version of python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   Make sure tu check the box "Add Python to Path" as enabled.

2. Go into your "Hypixel Status Checker" folder, click in the path-way line above and overwrite the path just by typing "cmd" and press enter.
   In the terminal type "pip install -r req.txt"

3. Put your names you want in the "names.txt" file. Make sure there is one name in each line and check the orthography.
   Some names dont work because they are blocked, Not Taken, Never Joined or is banned on Hypixel.

4. Start Minecraft and join "hypixel.net"
   On the server you just type "/API new"
   Copy the key, paste it in the "config.txt" file and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with the key you just copied.

5. If you've done everything correctly, you now can start the program by opening the "HypixelStatusChecker.py" file.


NOTE: You have to start the program twice. So on the first start nothing happens idk.

---------------------------------
Here I explain the two basic questions you may have.

What does it do?
- It's created to permanently track the online status on Hypixel from the players you want. You can (almost) put as many people in the names.txt file as you want.

Why is this useful?
- This is useful if you really want to contact someone in Minecraft. In Minecraft, you can't just contact people, except on servers.
  Because of this, it is checking the online status over and over to make sure you are able to see when the player is online.
  Normally you just look at a website, but if you want to track multiple people at once and without refreshing the website the entire time, then this is exactly what you need.
